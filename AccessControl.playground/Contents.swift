// `private` declarations are accessible only within the defined class or struct
// `fileprivate` declarations are accessible only within the current swift file
// `internal` declarations are accessible only within the defined module (default)
// `public` declarations are accessible from everywhere
// `open` declarations similar to public, but classes and methods marked as open can be subclassed and overridden respectively out of their defining module.
